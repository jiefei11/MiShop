    <p>Our Privacy Policy was updated on January 20, 2022.</p>
    <p>Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Mi Account and its related services, including account creation, sign-in, and management, are provided by Xiaomi and its affiliated companies (hereinafter referred to as "Xiaomi", "we", "our", or "us").</p>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy sets out the principles on which Mi Account operates, and constitutes an important part of Xiaomi Privacy Policy. In the event of inconsistency between this Privacy Policy and Xiaomi Privacy Policy with respect to Mi Account, the former shall prevail. For the terms and conditions not stipulated in this Privacy Policy, Xiaomi Privacy Policy shall prevail. Terms and conditions regarding the protection of minors, security measures, and cross-border data transmission can be found in <a href="https://privacy.mi.com/all/en_US/">Xiaomi Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is designed with your needs in mind, and it is important that you have a comprehensive understanding of our personal information collection and usage practices, while ensuring that ultimately, you have control of your personal information provided to Xiaomi. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, process and store any information that you give us when you use Mi Account. You may consult the privacy policies of the relevant services for terms and conditions regarding collection and use of personal information when you use other services while signed in to your Mi Account. Under this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify an individual, either from that information alone or from that information combined with other information about that individual available to Xiaomi. We will use your personal information strictly following this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, what we want is the best for all our users. Should you have any questions about our data handling practices as summarized in this Privacy Policy, please contact us via <a href="https://privacy.mi.com/support">https://privacy.mi.com/support</a> to address your specific concerns. We will be happy to hear from you.

    <h2>1. What information we collect and how we use it</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Personal information that we collect and use with your authorization</h3>
    <p>The purpose of collecting personal information is to provide you with products and/or services, and to ensure that we comply with applicable laws, regulations and other regulatory requirements. You have the right to choose whether or not to provide the information we have requested, but in most cases, if you do not provide your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to your queries. Features and services that may need to collect your personal information include:</p>
    <p>1.1.1 Basic features</p>
    <p>A. Creating accounts and signing in</p>
    <p>When registering a new Mi Account, you will need to provide a phone number or email address to use as the account name and create a password. Your account and password will be encrypted and stored to our servers. We strongly advise you not to share your password information to prevent theft of your Mi Account by others.</p>
    <p>We will automatically obtain and fill in your phone number when you register and sign in to your Mi Account. To provide this service, we will collect your <strong>SIM card IMSI and ICCID</strong>, device model, system version information, and network status. You may be required to grant Mi Account permissions to access your network and Wi-Fi status in order for us to be able to collect and use the information necessary to provide these features.</p>
    <p>B. Completing account information</p>
    <p>While using various Xiaomi services, you may receive better service quality and user experience by adding basic information to your Mi Account profile, including profile photo, nickname, gender, and country or region, as well as setting up a secret question for security purposes. If you choose not to provide this information, this will not affect your use of the basic services and features of Mi Account.</p>
    <p>C. Sharing features</p>
    <p>You can use the Xiaomi sharing feature to share Xiaomi services, content, and promotions with your family and friends. You can also share your Xiaomi Cloud space and location information. To provide these services, we will collect your <strong>Mi Account ID</strong>, current location, and the <strong>Mi Account ID and/or phone number</strong> of the person or people you invite to share content.</p>
    <p>1.1.2 Features necessary for ensuring account creation and sign-in security</p>
    <p>In order to enhance system security when you use our products and/or services, prevent phishing website fraud, and protect account security, we will verify your identity through SMS verification as well as secondary verification when necessary. To this end, we will collect SMS verification codes and secondary verification codes.</p>
    <p>We will also collect your account creation/sign-in time, device-related information (such as <strong>IMEI/OAID (on Android Q)</strong>, device model, and operating system version), device sensor information (such as angular velocity and acceleration), and network information (such as the IP address generally used when signing in) in order to judge whether or not the account creation or sign-in environment is secure.</p>
    <h3>1.2 You are fully informed that we may collect and use personal information without your consent if:</h3>
    <p>1.2.1 The personal information is vital to national security and defense;</p>
    <p>1.2.2 The personal information is vital to public safety, public health, and major public interests;</p>
    <p>1.2.3 The personal information is related to criminal investigations, prosecutions, trials, or execution of judgments;</p>
    <p>1.2.4 The personal information is essential for protecting major legitimate rights (including life and property) and interests of the personal information subject or other people, but it is hard to obtain the subject's consent;</p>
    <p>1.2.5 The personal information collected is made public by the subject at their own discretion;</p>
    <p>1.2.6 The personal information is collected from public sources, such as news reports or government announcements;</p>
    <p>1.2.7 The personal information is necessary for us to sign the contract as required by you;</p>
    <p>1.2.8 The personal information is necessary to maintain the safe and steady operation of products and/or services provided, such as for discovering and handling faults of products and/or services;</p>
    <p>1.2.9 The personal information is required for legal news releases; and</p>
    <p>1.2.10 The personal information is de-identified in the results of statistical or academic research based on public interest.</p>
    <h3>1.3 Collection of personal information from third-party sources</h3>
    <p>When permitted by law, we will collect information about you from third-party sources. For example, you may authorize the pairing of a third-party account with your Mi account, sign in to the third-party account to use Xiaomi services, or authorize your profile photo, nickname, or other information to be imported to the third-party platform; for risk management purposes, we may receive information regarding the security of your account creation/sign-in environment (such as phone number risk level databases) via a third party; or your family or friends may enter your Mi Account ID or phone number when they invite you to use sharing-related services.</p>
    <h3>1.4 Non-personally identifiable information</h3>
    <p>We may also collect other types of information which are not directly or indirectly linked to an individual (and which may not be defined as personal information). This information may include statistical data generated when you use a specific service, such as sign-in/sign-out records, interaction records, and error records when you use Mi Account services as well as the success/failure status of invitations and invitation acceptance when you use sharing services. The purpose of such collection is to improve the services we provide to you. The type and amount of information collected depends on how you use our products and/or services. We aggregate this information. In its aggregated form, data is not personal information and cannot be used to identify you. However, if we combine non-personally identifiable information with personal information, such combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>
    <h2>2. Sharing your personal information with third parties</h2>
    <p>To ensure that we provide you with the services described in this Privacy Policy, we may share necessary personal information with our partners and other third parties, including:</p>
    <p>2.1 Sign in with one tap: This service is provided by third parties including China Unicom Online Information Co., Ltd., Century Dragon Information Network Co., Ltd., and Shanghai Caiyan Network Technology Co., Ltd. In order to provide this service, we may share your <strong>SIM card IMSI and ICCID</strong>, <strong>IP information</strong>, device model, system version information, and network status with these third-party service providers.</p>
    <p>We guarantee that the sharing of personal information necessary for providing services to you is solely for legitimate, legal, necessary, specific, and explicit purposes. We will safeguard the security of your information through measures including but not limited to encryption. We will contractually stipulate the practices and obligations of third parties to ensure that third-party service providers comply with the privacy standards applicable in your jurisdiction. You should understand that our authorization for third-party service providers extends to sub-contractors of authorized third parties.</p>
    <p>2.2 Two-step verification: This service is provided by third party operators, including China Telecom, China Unicom, and China Mobile. To provide this service, we may provide these third parties with your <strong>phone number</strong> and the date on which your phone number was connected to your Mi Account (accurate to the day).</p>
    <p>2.3 When you sign in with Mi Account on a third-party website or app, we will, upon your authorization and approval, share your nickname, profile photo, and other information (depending on the nature of the third party's services and products) with the third party. If you do not wish to allow the third party to access your personal information, do not grant authorization.</p>
    <p>Please note that we will ensure the security of your information through means such as encryption, but handling of your personal information by third parties is subject to the privacy policy of the relevant third party. For this reason, we recommend that you read third parties' privacy policies just like you read ours. You can cancel authorization for third parties at any time in "Accounts and permissions" on <a href="https://account.xiaomi.com/">https://account.xiaomi.com/</a>.</p>
    <h2>3. Retention policy</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information for the period necessary for the purpose of the information collection described in this Privacy Policy or as required by applicable laws. We will cease to retain and delete or anonymize personal information once the purpose of collection is fulfilled, or after we confirm your request for erasure, or after we terminate the operation of the corresponding product or service. An exception to this is personal information that we are processing for public interest, scientific, historical research or statistical purposes. We will continue to retain this type of information for longer than its standard retention period, where permitted based on applicable laws, even if further data processing is not related to the original purpose of collection.</p>
    <h2>4. Your rights</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Controlling settings</h3>
    <p>We recognize that privacy concerns differ from person to person. Therefore, we provide examples of ways for you to restrict the collection, use, disclosure, or processing of your personal information and to control your privacy settings:</p>

    <p>• Sign in or out of the Mi Account.</p>
    <p>If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for the aforementioned purposes, you may change your mind at any time by contacting us on <a href="https://privacy.mi.com/support">https://privacy.mi.com/support</a>.</p>
    <h3>4.2 Your rights to your personal information</h3>
    <p>Depending on applicable laws and regulations, you have the right to access, rectification, and erasure of any other personal information that we hold about you (hereinafter referred to as "the request").</p>
    <p>You may also access and update the details relating to the personal information in your Mi Account at <a href="https://account.xiaomi.com/">http://account.xiaomi.com</a> or by signing in to your account on your device. For additional information, please write to us or contact us on <a href="https://privacy.mi.com/support">https://privacy.mi.com/support</a>.</p>
    <p>The request should meet the requirements of applicable laws and the following conditions:</p>
    <p>• The request is submitted through Xiaomi's exclusive request channel detailed above and for the protection of your information security, your request should be in writing (unless the local law explicitly recognizes the oral request);</p>
    <p>• You provide sufficient information to enable Xiaomi to verify your identity and ensure that you are the data subject or legally authorized to act on the data subject's behalf.</p>
    <p>Once we obtain sufficient information to confirm that your request can be processed, we shall proceed to respond to your request within any timeframe set out under your applicable data protection laws. In detail:</p>
    <p>• Based on the requirements of applicable laws, a copy of your personal data collected and processed by us will be provided to you upon your request free of charge. For any extra requests for relevant information, we may charge a reasonable fee based on actual administrative costs according to the applicable laws.</p>
    <p>• If any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, you are entitled to have your personal information corrected or completed based on the purpose of use.</p>
    <p>• Based on the requirements of applicable laws, you have the right to request the deletion or removal of your personal information. We shall consider the grounds regarding your erasure request and take reasonable steps, including technical measures. Please note that we may not be able to immediately remove the information from the backup system due to applicable legal restrictions and/or security technology limitations. If this is the case, we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until the backup can be cleared or be made anonymous.</p>
    <p>We have the right to refuse to process requests that are not meaningful, manifestly unfounded or excessive, requests that damage others' right to privacy, extremely unrealistic requests, and requests that require disproportionate technical work, as well as requests not required under local law, regarding information that has been made public, and regarding information given under confidential conditions. If we believe that certain aspects of the request to delete or access the information may result in our inability to legally use the information for the aforementioned anti-fraud and security purposes, it may also be rejected.</p>
    <h3>4.3 Withdrawal of consent</h3>
    <p>• You may submit a request to withdraw your consent for us to collect, use, and/or disclose your personal information held or controlled by us. You can do so in Settings &gt; Mi Account &gt; Terms and conditions, or by visiting "Privacy" on <a href="https://account.xiaomi.com/">https://account.xiaomi.com</a>.

    <p>• Attention: Your withdrawal of consent may result in some legal consequences. Additionally, you may not be able to continue receiving the full benefit of Xiaomi's products and services, depending on how much authority you grant us to process your information when you use Mi Account.

    <p>Please note that cancelation of the Mi Account will prevent you from using the full range of Xiaomi products and services. To protect your or others' legitimate rights and interests, we will judge whether or not to support your request for cancelation based on your use of various Xiaomi products and services. For example, if there still exist monies outstanding on your account, we cannot immediately support your request.</p>
